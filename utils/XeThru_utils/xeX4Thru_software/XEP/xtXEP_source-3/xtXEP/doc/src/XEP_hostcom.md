# Host communication {#xep_hostcom}

XEP features host communication with a set of defined serial protocol messages that are transported through a serial interface, typically UART or USB.

For a complete reference of the serial protocol, see **Module Connector** documentation.

From XEP, see xep_dispatch_messages.h for a list of methods used to send data to the host.
