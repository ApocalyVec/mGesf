 * \section spi_master_megarf_basic Basic setup for MEGARF devices
 * The SPI module will be set up as master:
 *  - SPI on PORTB
 *  - FOSC/16 as SPI clock speed
 *  - Slave Chip Select connected on PORTB pin 0
 *  - SPI mode 0 (data on rising clock edge)
 *
 * \section  spi_master_megarf_basic_setup Setup steps
 * \subsection spi_master_megarf_basic_setup_code Example code
 * Add to application C-file (e.g. main.c):
 * \code
	  #define SPI_SCK       IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 1)
	  #define SPI_MOSI      IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 2)
	  #define SPI_MISO      IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 3)

	   }
\endcode
 *
 * \subsection spi_master_megarf_basic_setup Workflow
 * -# Ensure that \ref conf_spi_master.h is present for the driver.
 *  - \note This file is only for the driver and should not be included by the
 * user. In this example the file can be left empty.
 * -# Initialize the pins used by the SPI interface (this initialization is for
 * the ATmega128rfa1 device).
 * -# Define the pins used by the SPI interface
 *  - \code
	#define SPI_SCK       IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 1)
	#define SPI_MOSI      IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 2)
	#define SPI_MISO      IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 3)
	#define SPI_SS        IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 0)
\endcode
 *  -# Set the pin used for slave select as output high:
 *    \code
	ioport_configure_port_pin(SPI_SS, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
\endcode
 *  -# Set MOSI and SCL as output high, and set MISO as input:
 *    \code
	ioport_configure_port_pin(SPI_SCK, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
	ioport_configure_port_pin(SPI_MOSI, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
	ioport_configure_port_pin(SPI_MISO, IOPORT_DIR_INPUT);
\endcode
 * -# Define the SPI device configuration struct to describe which pin the
 * slave select (slave chip select) is connected to, in this case the slave
 * select pin has been connected to PORTB pin 0 (PB0):
 *  - \code
	struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
	    .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 0)
	};
\endcode
 * -# Initialize the SPI module:
 *  - \code
	spi_master_init(&SPCR);
\endcode
 * -# Setup the SPI master module for a specific device:
 *  - \code
	spi_master_setup_device(&SPCR, &spi_device_conf, SPI_MODE_0, 1000000, 0);
\endcode
 *  - \note The last argument, which is zero in this case, can be ignored and is
 *  only included for compatibility purposes.
 * -# Then enable the SPI:
 *  - \code
	spi_enable(&SPCR);
\endcode
 *
 * \section spi_master_megarf_basic_usage Usage steps
 * \subsection spi_master_megarf_basic_usage_code Example code
 * Add to, e.g., the main loop in the application C-file:
 * \code
	   uint8_t data_buffer[1] = {0xD7};

	   struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
	       .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 0)
	   };

	   spi_select_device(&SPCR, &spi_device_conf);

	   spi_write_packet(&SPCR, data_buffer, 1);
	   spi_read_packet(&SPCR, data_buffer, 1);

	   spi_deselect_device(&SPCR, &spi_device_conf);
\endcode
 *
 * \subsection spi_master_megarf_basic_usage_flow Workflow
 * -# Create a buffer for data to be sent/received on the SPI bus, in this case
 * a single byte buffer is used. The buffer can be of arbitrary size as long as
 * there is space left in SRAM:
 *  - \code
	uint8_t data_buffer[1] = {0xD7};
\endcode
 * -# Define the SPI device configuration struct to describe which pin the
 * slave select (slave chip select) is connected to, in this case the slave
 * select pin has been connected to PORTB pin01 (PB0):
 *  - \code
	struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
	    .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTB, 0)
	};
\endcode
 *  - \note As this struct is the same for both the initializing part and the
 *usage
 * part it could be a good idea to make the struct global, and hence accessible
 * for both the initializing part and usage part. Another solution could be to
 * create the struct in the main function and pass the address of the struct to
 * the spi_init_module() function, e.g.:
 *  \code
	   void spi_init_module(struct spi_device *spi_device_conf)
	   {
	       ...

	       spi_master_setup_device(&SPCR, spi_device_conf, SPI_MODE_0, 
	       1000000, 0);

	       ...
	   }
\endcode
 * -# Write data to the SPI slave device, in this case write one byte from the
 * data_buffer:
 *  - \code
	spi_write_packet(&SPCR, data_buffer, 1);
\endcode
 * -# Read data from the SPI slave device, in this case read one byte and put it
 * into the data_buffer:
 *  - \code
	spi_read_packet(&SPCR, data_buffer, 1);
\endcode
 *  - \attention As the SPI works as a shift register so that data is shifted in
 * at the same time as data is shifted out a read operation will mean that a dummy
 * byte \ref CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_DUMMY is written to the SPI bus. \ref
 *  CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_DUMMY
 * defaults to 0xFF, but can be changed by defining it inside the \ref
 * conf_spi_master.h file.
 * -# When read and write operations is done de-select the slave:
 *  - \code
	spi_deselect_device(&SPCR, &spi_device_conf);
\endcode
 *
