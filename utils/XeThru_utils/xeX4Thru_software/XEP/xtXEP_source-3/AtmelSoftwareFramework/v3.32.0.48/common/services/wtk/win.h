 * \brief Window system for organizing window elements in a graphical user
 *        interface (GUI)
 * 
 * See "AVR1614: Widget Toolkit - Getting Started".
 *
 * The window system is a module for organizing two dimensional windows.
 * Windows are organized in a tree strcture where each window can have
 * one parent but several children. The window system also allows
 * events to be queued and handled by the event handler of the affected
 * windows.
 *
 * A window is defined with the following properties:
 * - A position and area/size
 * - Relation to parent and children
 * - Visibility
 * - Background
 * - Behavior flags
 * - Event handler
 *
 * The window system can be used separately or together with the
 * \ref wtk_group "Widget toolkit".
 *
 * \section relation_sec Positioning and relations
 *
 * The windows are organized in a tree structure. A window can be used for
 * graphical user interface (GUI) elements drawn on a screen or display.
 * These elements are often called widgets. The window system can be used
 * to organize any built-in or custom widget. Some examples of widgets are
 * frame, static text, button, checkbox or more advanced widgets like an
 * analog clock.
 *
 * Each window can have children, and the child windows must be contained within
 * the area of the parent window. This means the child window can be as large
 * as, but not be larger than the parent window.
 * A root window filling the entire screen is created when the window
 * system is initialized with \ref win_init. If the screen orientation
 * changes the root window can be re-initialized with
 * \ref win_reset_root_geometry. A pointer to the root window is returned
 * from \ref win_get_root.
 *
 * The following figure shows the relations between windows that are used to
 * represent some example widgets. In the figure we show the top_child and
 * next_sibling pointers. The parent and prev_sibling pointers which point
 * in the opposite direction are omitted to simplify the figure.
 *
 * The figure also illustrates how the position and size affects how
 * the windows could be represented on a display.

 *
 * \section visibility_sec Visibility
 * A window can only be shown if it has been mapped to the screen with the
 * \ref win_show function and that the parent windows are also mapped to the
 * screen.
 *
 * When a window is drawn, the following happens:
 * - If WIN_BEHAVIOR_REDRAW_PARENT attribute is set the parent will be drawn.
 * - Background for window will be drawn
 * - Event handler for window will be called to draw the window/widget.
 * - Children will be drawn starting with the bottom child and ending with the
 *   top child.

 *
 * \section event_handling_sec Event handling
 * Propagation of events are an important part of the window system.
 * Events are added to the event queue with one of queue functions
 * (\ref win_queue_pointer_event, \ref win_queue_keyboard_event,
 * \ref win_queue_command_event). Pending events in the event queue can be
 * processed by calling the \ref win_process_events function in the main
 * application loop.
 *
 * The events are handled differently depending on the event. Valid event types
 * are defined by \ref win_event_type.
 *
 * \sa win_create
 * \sa win_get_attributes
 * \sa win_set_attributes
 *
 * - Keyboard events are sent to the window which has focus. See
 *   \ref win_set_keyboard_focus. This means that the event handler for that
 *   window will be called. If the event handler does not accept the event
 *   (ie the event handler returns false), the event will be sent to
 *   the parent window. It will continue propagating to all parents until
 *   accepted. If no window accepts the event or no window has focus, the event
 *   will be discarded.
 *   \image html gfx_win_event_handling_keyboard_event.png
 *
 * - Command events are sent to the window which is set as recipient of the
 *   event \ref win_command_event "struct win_command_event".
 *   It will propagate up to parents in the same way as the keyboard events.
 *   \image html gfx_win_event_handling_command_event.png
 *
 * - Pointer events are handled a bit differently. If a window has requested to
 *   get all pointer events with the \ref win_grab_pointer function, the event
 *   handler for that window is called. The return value of this event handler
 *   is ignored.
 *   If no window has grabbed the pointer, the pointer event will start
 *   from the \ref win_root "root window". It will then search the children
 *   to find the window that is under the pointer. \ref win_is_inside_area
 *   If no window is found or the window under the pointer does not accept the
 *   event, it will search the recursively through the children.
 *   \see win_process_pointer_event.
 *   \image html gfx_win_event_handling_pointer_event.png
 *
 * - Window draw events are sent to the window to allow it to draw itself after
 *   the window system has drawn the background for the window.
 *   See \ref visibility_sec "window visibility"
 *
 * \section win_dependencies_sec Dependencies
 * This component driver depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref gfx_group "Graphics library"
