 * \page freertos_twi_peripheral_control_quick_start Quick start guide for
 * FreeRTOS TWI peripheral control functions
 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the
 * \ref freertos_twi_peripheral_control_group, with
 * step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use the service.
 *
 * The service can be initialized to operate in one of two different modes -
 * standard mode, and fully asynchronous mode.
 *
 * freertos_twi_write_packet() is used to transmit data in standard mode.
 * freertos_twi_write_packet() does not return until all the data has been
 * fully transmitted.  Other FreeRTOS tasks will execute while the data
 * transmission is in progress.
 *
 * freertos_twi_read_packet() is used to receive data in standard mode.
 * freertos_twi_read_packet() does not return until all the requested data has
 * been received.  This is safe because, in master mode, the amount of data
 * being received is controlled by the receiving device, and therefore known in
 * advance.  Other FreeRTOS tasks will execute while the data is being received.
 *
 * freertos_twi_write_packet_async() is used to transmit data in the fully
 * asynchronous mode.  freertos_twi_write_packet_async() returns as soon as
 * the data transmission has started (not when it has finished), and can opt to
 * be notified by FreeRTOS when the transmission is complete.  The buffer being
 * transmitted must not be altered until the transmission is complete.
 *
 * freertos_twi_write_packet_async() and freertos_twi_read_packet_async() must
 * not be used when the peripheral is initialized to use standard mode.
 * Likewise, freertos_twi_write_packet() and freertos_twi_read_packet()
 * must not be used when the peripheral is configured to use fully asynchronous
 * mode.
 *
 * Refer to the FreeRTOS peripheral control projects in the Atmel ASF
 * distribution for complete working examples, and the
 * <a href="http://www.FreeRTOS.org" target="_blank">FreeRTOS web site</a> for

 * \page freertos_twi_rx_async Receiving using the FreeRTOS TWI driver in fully
 * asynchronous mode
 *
 * This example demonstrates using the FreeRTOS TWI driver to receive data using
 * the fully asynchronous operation mode.  See \ref
 * freertos_twi_initialization_sync
 *
 * The example below implements a function that receives a block of data, then
 * processes the received data while another bock is being received.
 *
 * Refer to the FreeRTOS peripheral control projects in the Atmel ASF
 * distribution for complete working examples, and the
 * <a href="http://www.FreeRTOS.org" target="_blank">FreeRTOS web site</a> for
 * information on getting started with FreeRTOS.

	 // mode.
