 * \mainpage Widget ToolKit training
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 * This is the skeleton application to be used with the application note
 * <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8300.pdf">AVR1614: Widget Toolkit -
 * Getting Started</a>.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * The main files of interest to the user are:
 * - \ref main.c
 * - \ref app_widget.c
 * - \ref app_widget.h
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * This training has been tested with the mXT143E Xplained on the following
 * boards:
 * - UC3-A3 Xplained
 * - UC3-L0 Xplained
 * - XMEGA-A1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA-B1 Xplained
 * - XMEGA-A3BU Xplained
 * - SAM4S Xplained
 *
 * Please ensure that the SPI mode switch on the mXT143E Xplained is in the
 * correct position for your evaluation board:
 * - "XMEGA USART in SPI mode" for XMEGA
 * - "Native SPI" for others
 *
 * \section description Training description
 * This application is made as a training to introduce users to some of the
 * available widgets in the \ref gfx_wtk "Widget toolkit".
 *
 * Initially this application will draw a \ref gfx_wtk_basic_frame "basic frame"
 * filling the entire screen and add a \ref gfx_wtk_slider "slider" and a
 * \ref gfx_wtk_progress_bar "progress bar" on the upper half of the screen.
 *
 * The user's task is then to add a \ref gfx_wtk_basic_frame "sub-frame" and a
 * \ref gfx_wtk_button "button". The button should increment a counter presented
 * in the sub-frame each time the button is pressed.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * The most relevant module dependencies for this training are:
 * - \ref gfx_group
 * - \ref win_group
 * - \ref wtk_group
 * - \ref mxt_group
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
 * For further information, visit <a href="http://www.atmel.com/">Atmel</a>.\n
