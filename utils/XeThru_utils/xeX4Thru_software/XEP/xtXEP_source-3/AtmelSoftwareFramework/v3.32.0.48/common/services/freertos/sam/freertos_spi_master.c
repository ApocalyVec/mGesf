 *
 * freertos_spi_master_init() is an ASF specific FreeRTOS driver function.  It
 * must be called before any other ASF specific FreeRTOS driver functions
 * attempt to access the same SPI port.
 *
 * If freertos_driver_parameters->operation_mode equals SPI_MASTER then

 * freertos_spi_master_init() will not take any action.
 *
 * Other ASF SPI functions, such as those to set the SPI clock rate and other
 * bus parameters, can be called after freertos_spi_master_init() has completed
 * successfully.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the SPI PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * This driver is provided with an application note, and an example project that
 * demonstrates the use of this function.

 * It configures the SPI peripheral DMA controller (PDC) to transmit data on the
 * SPI port, then returns.  freertos_spi_write_packet_async() does not wait for
 * the transmission to complete before returning.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS SPI driver is initialized using a call to
 * freertos_spi_master_init().  The freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags
 * parameter passed into the initialization function defines the driver behavior.
 * freertos_spi_write_packet_async() can only be used if the
 * freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the initialization
 * function had the WAIT_TX_COMPLETE bit clear.
 *
 * freertos_spi_write_packet_async() is an advanced function and readers are
 * recommended to also reference the application note and examples that
 * accompany the FreeRTOS ASF drivers.  freertos_spi_write_packet() is a version
 * that does not exit until the PDC transfer is complete, but still allows other
 * RTOS tasks to execute while the transmission is in progress.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the SPI PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * \param p_spi    The handle to the SPI peripheral returned by the
 *     freertos_spi_master_init() call used to initialise the peripheral.
 * \param data    A pointer to the data to be transmitted.
 * \param len    The number of bytes to transmit.
 * \param block_time_ticks    The FreeRTOS ASF SPI driver is initialized using a
 *     call to freertos_spi_master_init().  The
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the
 *     initialization function defines the driver behavior.  If
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags had the USE_TX_ACCESS_SEM bit
 *     set, then the driver will only write to the SPI peripheral if it has
 *     first gained exclusive access to it.  block_time_ticks specifies the
 *     maximum amount of time the driver will wait to get exclusive access
 *     before aborting the write operation.  Other tasks will execute during any
 *     waiting time.  block_time_ticks is specified in RTOS tick periods.  To
 *     specify a block time in milliseconds, divide the milliseconds value by
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS, and pass the result in block_time_ticks.
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS is defined by FreeRTOS.
 * \param notification_semaphore    The RTOS task that calls the transmit
 *     function exits the transmit function as soon as the transmission starts.
 *     The data being transmitted by the PDC must not be modified until after
 *     the transmission has completed.  The PDC interrupt (handled internally by
 *     the FreeRTOS ASF driver) 'gives' the semaphore when the PDC transfer
 *     completes.  The notification_semaphore therefore provides a mechanism for
 *     the calling task to know when the PDC has finished accessing the data.
 *     The calling task can call standard FreeRTOS functions to block on the
 *     semaphore until the PDC interrupt occurs.  Other RTOS tasks will execute
 *     while the the calling task is in the Blocked state.  The semaphore must
