 *
 * freertos_uart_serial_init() is an ASF specific FreeRTOS driver function.  It
 * must be called before any other ASF specific FreeRTOS driver functions
 * attempt to access the same UART port.
 *
 * If freertos_driver_parameters->operation_mode equals UART_RS232 then
 * freertos_uart_serial_init() will configure the UART port for standard RS232
 * operation.  If freertos_driver_parameters->operation_mode equals any other
 * value then freertos_uart_serial_init() will not take any action.
 *
 * Other ASF UART functions can be called after freertos_uart_serial_init()
 * has completed successfully.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the UART PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * This driver is provided with an application note, and an example project that
 * demonstrates the use of this function.
 *
 * \param p_uart    The UART peripheral being initialized.
 * \param uart_parameters    Structure that defines the UART bus and transfer
 *     parameters, such the baud rate and the number of data bits.
 *     sam_uart_opt_t is a standard ASF type (it is not FreeRTOS specific).
 * \param freertos_driver_parameters    Defines the driver behavior.  See the
 *    freertos_peripheral_options_t documentation, and the application note that
 *    accompanies the ASF specific FreeRTOS functions.
 *
 * \return If the initialization completes successfully then a handle that can

 * \brief Initiate a completely asynchronous multi-byte write operation on a
 * UART peripheral.
 *
 * freertos_uart_write_packet_async() is an ASF specific FreeRTOS driver
 * function.  It configures the UART peripheral DMA controller (PDC) to
 * transmit data on the UART port, then returns.
 * freertos_uart_write_packet_async() does not wait for the transmission to
 * complete before returning.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS UART driver is initialized using a call to
 * freertos_uart_serial_init().  The freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags
 * parameter passed into the initialization function defines the driver behavior.
 * freertos_uart_write_packet_async() can only be used if the
 * freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the initialization
 * function had the WAIT_TX_COMPLETE bit clear.
 *
 * freertos_uart_write_packet_async() is an advanced function and readers are
 * recommended to also reference the application note and examples that
 * accompany the FreeRTOS ASF drivers.  freertos_uart_write_packet() is a
 * version that does not exit until the PDC transfer is complete, but still
 * allows other RTOS tasks to execute while the transmission is in progress.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the UART PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * \param p_uart    The handle to the UART peripheral returned by the
 *     freertos_uart_serial_init() call used to initialise the peripheral.
 * \param data    A pointer to the data to be transmitted.
 * \param len    The number of bytes to transmit.
 * \param block_time_ticks    The FreeRTOS ASF UART driver is initialized using
 *     a call to freertos_uart_serial_init().  The
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the
 *     initialization function defines the driver behavior.  If
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags had the USE_TX_ACCESS_SEM bit
 *     set, then the driver will only write to the UART peripheral if it has
 *     first gained exclusive access to it.  block_time_ticks specifies the
 *     maximum amount of time the driver will wait to get exclusive access
 *     before aborting the write operation.  Other tasks will execute during any
 *     waiting time.  block_time_ticks is specified in RTOS tick periods.  To
 *     specify a block time in milliseconds, divide the milliseconds value by
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS, and pass the result in block_time_ticks.
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS is defined by FreeRTOS.
 * \param notification_semaphore    The RTOS task that calls the transmit
 *     function exits the transmit function as soon as the transmission starts.
 *     The data being transmitted by the PDC must not be modified until after
 *     the transmission has completed.  The PDC interrupt (handled internally by
 *     the FreeRTOS ASF driver) 'gives' the semaphore when the PDC transfer
 *     completes.  The notification_semaphore therefore provides a mechanism for
 *     the calling task to know when the PDC has finished accessing the data.
 *     The calling task can call standard FreeRTOS functions to block on the
 *     semaphore until the PDC interrupt occurs.  Other RTOS tasks will execute
 *     while the the calling task is in the Blocked state.  The semaphore must
 *     be created using the FreeRTOS vSemaphoreCreateBinary() API function
 *     before it is used as a parameter.
 *
 * \return     ERR_INVALID_ARG is returned if an input parameter is invalid.
 *     ERR_TIMEOUT is returned if block_time_ticks passed before exclusive
 *     access to the UART peripheral could be obtained.  STATUS_OK is returned
 *     if the PDC was successfully configured to perform the UART write
 *     operation.
