/**
 * \defgroup asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_group SAM4L Peripheral Event Controller (PEVC) Driver
 *
 * This driver for Atmel&reg; | SMART ARM&reg;-based microcontrollers 
 * provides a unified interface for the configuration and
 * management of the Event Channels.
 *
 * The peripheral event generators and users are interconnected by a network
 * known as the Peripheral Event System.
 *
 * The Peripheral Event System allows low latency peripheral-to-peripheral
 * signaling without CPU intervention, and without consuming system resources
 * such as bus or RAM bandwidth. This offloads the CPU and system resources
 * compared to a traditional interrupt-based software driven system.
 *
 * Devices from the following series can use this module:
 * - Atmel | SMART SAM4L
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_prerequisites
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_module_overview
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_special_considerations
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_extra_info
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_examples
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_api_overview
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * Peripherals within the SAM4L device are capable of generating two types of
 * actions in response to a given stimulus; they can set a register flag for later
 * intervention by the CPU (using interrupt or polling methods), or they can
 * generate event signals which can be internally routed directly to other
 * peripherals within the device. The use of events allows for direct actions
 * to be performed in one peripheral in response to a stimulus in another
 * without CPU intervention. This can lower the overall power consumption of the
 * system if the CPU is able to remain in sleep modes for longer periods, and
 * lowers the latency of the system response.
 *
 * The Peripheral Event System is comprised of a number of freely configurable Event
 * Channels, plus a number of fixed Event Users. Each Event Channel can be
 * configured to select the input peripheral that will generate the events on
 * the channel, as well as the Event Shaper (EVS) and Input Glitch Filter (IGF)
 * operating modes. The fixed-function Event Users, connected to peripherals
 * within the device, can then subscribe to an Event Channel in a one-to-many
 * relationship in order to receive events as they are generated. An overview
 * of the event system chain is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_fig "the figure below".
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_fig
 * \dot
 * digraph overview {
 *   rankdir=LR;
 *   node [label="Generator" shape=rectangle] event_src_gen0;
 *   node [label="Generator" shape=rectangle] event_src_gen1;
 *   node [label="Peripheral\nEvent System" shape=rectangle style=""] event_system;
 *   node [label="User" shape=rectangle style=""] event_user0;
 *   node [label="User/\nGenerator" shape=rectangle style=""] event_user1;
 *
 *   event_src_gen0 -> event_system -> event_user0;
 *   event_src_gen1 -> event_system -> event_user1 -> event_system;
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * There are many different events that can be routed in the device, which can
 * then trigger many different actions. For example, an Analog Comparator module
 * could be configured to generate an event when the input signal rises above
 * the compare threshold, which then triggers a Timer Counter module to capture
 * the current count value for later use.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_event_channels Event Channels
 * The Peripheral Event Controller module in the SAM4L device consists of several
 * channels, which can be freely linked to an Event Generator (i.e. a peripheral
 * within the device that is capable of generating events). Each channel can be
 * individually configured to select the generator peripheral, signal path,
 * Event Shaper (EVS), and Input Glitch Filter (IGF) applied to the input event
 * signal, before being passed to any event user(s).
 *
 * Event Channels can support multiple users within the device in a standardized
 * manner; when an Event User is linked to an Event Channel, the channel will
 * automatically handshake with all attached users to ensure that all modules
 * correctly receive and acknowledge the event.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_event_users Event Users
 * Event Users are able to subscribe to an Event Channel, once it has been
 * configured. Each Event User consists of a fixed connection to one of the
 * peripherals within the device (for example, an ADC module or Timer module)
 * and is capable of being connected to a single Event Channel.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_module_overview_event_shaper Event Shaper (EVS)
 * The Peripheral Event Controller module contains Event Shapers (EVS) for
 * external inputs and general purpose waveforms (i.e. timer outputs or Generic
 * Clocks) that require synchronisation and/or edge detection prior to peripheral
 * event propagation.
 *
 * Each Event Shaper is responsible for shaping one generator input prior to
 * it going through an Event Channel.
 *
 * Refer to the module configuration section at the end
 * of the Peripheral Event Controller (PEVC) section in the device datasheet for the
 * specific configuration of Event Shapers and Input Glitch Filters.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_module_overview_input_glitch_filer Input Glitch Filter (IGF)
 * The Peripheral Event Controller module contains Input Glitch Filters (IGF)
 * specifically to allow I/O inputs to be sampled periodically. Input Glitch
 * Filtering can be turned on or off in the Event Shaper associated with the
 * Event Channel.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_physical Physical Connection
 *
 * \ref asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_int_connections_fig "The diagram below"
 * shows how this module is interconnected within the device.
 *

 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_config Configuring Events
 * Several steps are required to properly configure an event chain, so that
 * hardware peripherals can respond to events generated by each other,
 * listed below.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_config_src Source Peripheral
 *  -# The source peripheral (that will generate events) must be configured and
 *     enabled.
 *  -# The source peripheral (that will generate events) must have an output
 *     event enabled.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_config_evsys Event System
 *  -# The event system channel must be configured and enabled, with the
 *     correct source peripheral selected as the channel's Event Generator.
 *  -# The event system user must be configured and enabled, with the
 *     correct source Event Channel selected as the source.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_events_overview_config_dst Destination Peripheral
 *  -# The destination peripheral (that will receive events) must be configured
 *     and enabled.
 *  -# The destination peripheral (that will receive events) must have an input
 *     event enabled.
 *
