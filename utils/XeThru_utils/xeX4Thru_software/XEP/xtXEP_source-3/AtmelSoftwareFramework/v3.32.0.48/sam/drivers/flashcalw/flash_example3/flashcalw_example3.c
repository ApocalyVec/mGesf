/**

 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the FLASHCALW software driver.
 *
 * It also comes bundled with several examples. Using a Fibonacci calculation,
 * this example demonstrates how much the PicoCache feature can improve the
 * execution speed.
 *
 * \note The PicoCache always has a positive impact in terms of power
 * consumption (Explanation: since the PicoCache features allows to do less
 * access to the Flash, the power consumption is therefore reduced). Note
 * however that the PicoCache feature may have a negligible negative impact on
 * the execution speed when there are no wait states on the Flash (which may be
 * the case when the CPU runs at 12MHz in some cases). See also the Flash
 * Characteristics in the electrical characteristics section of the datasheet
 * for more information.
 *
 * Operating mode of the example:
 *   -# After reset, the example will run without PicoCache at 48MHz with 1 wait
 * state.
 *   -# A Fibonacci calculation will be done.
 *   -# The power consumption of the calculation without PicoCache will be
 * displayed on the board monitor.
 *   -# The time spent on the Fibonacci will be displayed on the debug monitor.
 *   -# PicoCache will be enabled.
 *   -# The Fibonacci calculation will be done again.
 *   -# The power consumption of the calculation with PicoCache will be
 * displayed on the board monitor.
 *   -# The time spent on the Fibonacci will be displayed on the debug monitor.
 *   -# The cache hit number will be displayed on the debug monitor, which is
 * the cause of the performance improvement and power consumption decrease.
 *   -# Then the example will run without PicoCache at 12MHz with 0 wait state.
 *   -# A Fibonacci calculation will be done.
 *   -# The power consumption of the calculation without PicoCache will be
 * displayed on the board monitor.
 *   -# The time spent on the Fibonacci will be displayed on the debug monitor.
 *   -# PicoCache will be enabled.
 *   -# The Fibonacci calculation will be done again.
 *   -# The power consumption of the calculation with PicoCache will be
 * displayed on the board monitor. The power consumption will be lower.
 *   -# The time spent on the Fibonacci will be displayed on the debug monitor.
 *   -# The cache hit number will be displayed on the debug monitor, which is
 * the cause of the performance improvement and power consumption decrease.
