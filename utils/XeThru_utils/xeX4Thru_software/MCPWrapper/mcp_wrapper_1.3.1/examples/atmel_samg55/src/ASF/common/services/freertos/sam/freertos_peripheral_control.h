/**
 * \defgroup freertos_service_group FreeRTOS Peripheral Control
 *
 * ASF specific FreeRTOS functionality that integrates ASF driver libraries with
 * FreeRTOS services to provide a set of highly efficient peripheral interface
 * functions.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF functions use the peripheral DMA controller (PDC) to send
 * and receive data with practically no processing overhead, and use the
 * FreeRTOS multi-tasking services to ensure the microcontroller can continue
 * executing application code at all times, even when one thread of execution
 * has to wait for a transmit or receive to complete.
 *
 * Peripherals can be initialized to execute is standard mode or fully
 * asynchronous mode.  In standard mode, the API functions used to transmit to
 * or receive from a peripheral do not return until the entire transmit or
 * receive operation has completed.  Other FreeRTOS tasks exeucte while the data
 * transfer is in progress.  In fully asynchronous mode, the API functions used
 * to transmit to or receive from a peripheral return immediately, which may be
 * while the data transfer is still in progress - the task calling the
 * transmit or receive function is then notified by FreeRTOS when the data
 * transfer has completed.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF drivers are supported by an application note, executable
 * examples within the ASF distribution, and example use cases in this
 * documentation set.
 *
 * The following functions are provided for the USART peripheral
 *
 * - freertos_usart_serial_init()
 * - freertos_usart_write_packet()
 * - freertos_usart_write_packet_async()
 * - freertos_usart_serial_read_packet()
 *
 * See \ref freertos_usart_peripheral_control_quick_start
 *
 * The following functions are provided for the UART peripheral
 *
 * - freertos_uart_serial_init()
 * - freertos_uart_write_packet()
 * - freertos_uart_write_packet_async()
 * - freertos_uart_serial_read_packet()
 *
 * See \ref freertos_uart_peripheral_control_quick_start
 *
 * The following functions are provided for the TWI peripheral
 *
 * - freertos_twi_master_init()
 * - freertos_twi_write_packet()
 * - freertos_twi_write_packet_async()
 * - freertos_twi_read_packet()
 * - freertos_twi_read_packet_async()
 *
 * See \ref freertos_twi_peripheral_control_quick_start
 *
 * The following functions are provided for the TWIHS peripheral
 *

 * - freertos_twihs_write_packet()
 * - freertos_twihs_write_packet_async()
 * - freertos_twihs_read_packet()
 * - freertos_twihs_read_packet_async()
 *
 * See \ref freertos_twihs_peripheral_control_quick_start
 *
 * The following functions are provided for the SPI peripheral
 *
 * - freertos_spi_master_init()
 * - freertos_spi_write_packet()
 * - freertos_spi_write_packet_async()
