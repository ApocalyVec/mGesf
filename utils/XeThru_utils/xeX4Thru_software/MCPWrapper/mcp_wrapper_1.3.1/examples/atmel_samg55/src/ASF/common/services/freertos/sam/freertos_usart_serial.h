 * \brief Initiate a multi-byte write operation on an USART peripheral.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet() is an ASF specific FreeRTOS driver function. It
 * configures the USART peripheral DMA controller (PDC) to transmit data on the
 * USART port, then waits until the transmission is complete. Other RTOS tasks
 * execute while the transmission is in progress.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() is a version that does not wait for the
 * transmission to complete before returning.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF USART driver is initialized using a call to
 * freertos_usart_serial_init().  The freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags
 * parameter passed into the initialization function defines the driver
 * behavior.
 * freertos_usart_write_packet() can only be used if the
 * freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the
 * initialization function had the WAIT_TX_COMPLETE bit set.
 *
 * Readers are recommended to also reference the application note and examples
 * that accompany the FreeRTOS ASF drivers.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the USART PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * \param p_usart    The handle to the USART port returned by the
 *     freertos_usart_serial_init() call used to initialise the port.
 * \param data    A pointer to the data to be transmitted.
 * \param len    The number of bytes to transmit.
 * \param block_time_ticks    The FreeRTOS ASF USART driver is initialized using
 *     a call to freertos_usart_serial_init().  The
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the
 *     initialization function defines the driver behavior.  If
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags had the USE_TX_ACCESS_MUTEX bit
 *     set, then the driver will only write to the USART peripheral if it has
 *     first gained exclusive access to it.  block_time_ticks specifies the
 *     maximum amount of time the driver will wait to get exclusive access before
 *     aborting the write operation.  Other tasks will execute during any
 *     waiting time.  block_time_ticks is specified in RTOS tick periods.  To
 *     specify a block time in milliseconds, divide the milliseconds value by
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS, and pass the result in block_time_ticks.
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS is defined by FreeRTOS.
 *
 * \return     ERR_INVALID_ARG is returned if an input parameter is invalid.
 *     ERR_TIMEOUT is returned if block_time_ticks passed before exclusive access
 *     to the USART peripheral could be obtained.  STATUS_OK is returned if the
 *     PDC was successfully configured to perform the USART write operation.

/**
 * \page freertos_usart_peripheral_control_quick_start Quick start guide for
 * FreeRTOS USART peripheral control functions
 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the
 * \ref freertos_usart_peripheral_control_group, with
 * step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use the service.
 *
 * The service can be initialized to operate in one of two different modes -
 * standard transmit mode, and fully asynchronous transmit mode.  There is only
 * one receive mode.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet() is used to transmit data in standard mode.
 * freertos_usart_write_packet() does not return until all the data has been
 * fully transmitted.  Other FreeRTOS tasks will execute while the data
 * transmission is in progress.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() is used to transmit data in the fully
 * asynchronous mode.  freertos_usart_write_packet_async() returns as soon as
 * the data transmission has started (not when it has finished), and can opt to
 * be notified by FreeRTOS when the transmission is complete.  The buffer being
 * transmitted must not be altered until the transmission is complete.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() must not be used when the peripheral is
 * initialized to use standard mode.  Likewise, freertos_usart_write_packet()
 * must not be used when the peripheral is configured to use fully asynchronous
 * mode.
 *
 * On asynchronous full duplex peripherals, such as the USART, data can be
 * received at any time, not just when a receive function is called.  On these
 * peripherals, to ensure data is not lost, the FreeRTOS drivers are configured
 * to place all received data into a dma buffer, no matter when the data arrives.
 * When a receive function is called, the data already in the dma buffer is
 * copied into the user buffer specified in a parameter to the receive function.
 * Available but unread data remains in the dma buffer, ready for the next
 * receive function call.
 *
 * Refer to the FreeRTOS peripheral control projects in the Atmel ASF
 * distribution for complete working examples, and the
