 * \ingroup freertos_usart_peripheral_control_group
 * \brief Initiate a completely asynchronous multi-byte write operation on a
 * USART peripheral.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() is an ASF specific FreeRTOS driver
 * function.  It configures the USART peripheral DMA controller (PDC) to
 * transmit data on the USART port, then returns.
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() does not wait for the transmission to
 * complete before returning.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS USART driver is initialized using a call to
 * freertos_usart_serial_init().  The freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags
 * parameter passed into the initialization function defines the driver behavior.
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() can only be used if the
 * freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the initialization
 * function had the WAIT_TX_COMPLETE bit clear.
 *
 * freertos_usart_write_packet_async() is an advanced function and readers are
 * recommended to also reference the application note and examples that
 * accompany the FreeRTOS ASF drivers.  freertos_usart_write_packet() is a
 * version that does not exit until the PDC transfer is complete, but still
 * allows other RTOS tasks to execute while the transmission is in progress.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS ASF driver both installs and handles the USART PDC interrupts.
 * Users do not need to concern themselves with interrupt handling, and must
 * not install their own interrupt handler.
 *
 * \param p_usart    The handle to the USART peripheral returned by the
 *     freertos_usart_serial_init() call used to initialise the peripheral.
 * \param data    A pointer to the data to be transmitted.
 * \param len    The number of bytes to transmit.
 * \param block_time_ticks    The FreeRTOS ASF USART driver is initialized using
 *     a call to freertos_usart_serial_init().  The
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags parameter passed to the
 *     initialization function defines the driver behavior.  If
 *     freertos_driver_parameters.options_flags had the USE_TX_ACCESS_MUTEX bit
 *     set, then the driver will only write to the USART peripheral if it has
 *     first gained exclusive access to it.  block_time_ticks specifies the
 *     maximum amount of time the driver will wait to get exclusive access
 *     before aborting the write operation.  Other tasks will execute during any
 *     waiting time.  block_time_ticks is specified in RTOS tick periods.  To
 *     specify a block time in milliseconds, divide the milliseconds value by
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS, and pass the result in block_time_ticks.
 *     portTICK_RATE_MS is defined by FreeRTOS.
 * \param notification_semaphore    The RTOS task that calls the transmit
 *     function exits the transmit function as soon as the transmission starts.
 *     The data being transmitted by the PDC must not be modified until after
 *     the transmission has completed.  The PDC interrupt (handled internally by
 *     the FreeRTOS ASF driver) 'gives' the semaphore when the PDC transfer
 *     completes.  The notification_semaphore therefore provides a mechanism for
 *     the calling task to know when the PDC has finished accessing the data.
 *     The calling task can call standard FreeRTOS functions to block on the
 *     semaphore until the PDC interrupt occurs.  Other RTOS tasks will execute
 *     while the the calling task is in the Blocked state.  The semaphore must
 *     be created using the FreeRTOS vSemaphoreCreateBinary() API function
 *     before it is used as a parameter.
 *
 * \return     ERR_INVALID_ARG is returned if an input parameter is invalid.
 *     ERR_TIMEOUT is returned if block_time_ticks passed before exclusive
 *     access to the USART peripheral could be obtained.  STATUS_OK is returned
 *     if the PDC was successfully configured to perform the USART write
 *     operation.
